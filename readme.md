/*
Sometimes, I want to view all of a Feedly feed at once instead of dealing with Feedly's lackluster GUI.

Of course, this works with any RSS reader; just supplement the feedly.com bit with another hosts' url that you don't want to open.

Warning: Your browser may crash when you try to open more than 15 urls/links/feeds at once.
